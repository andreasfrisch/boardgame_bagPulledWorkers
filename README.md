# Xarkant
A bag pull'er worker placement game

## General Idea
Action tokens are pulled from a bag, and only the players whose tokens got pulled get to act.
The tokens are not put back into the bag until the end of the round, so all actions will be had.

Players are fighting over a randomized land, harvesting resources, building workshops and churches, and staking their claims.

## Required resources:
30 Wheat resources
30 Wood resources
30 Stone resources

Church Board
State Board
10 Landscape tiles
6 Village Tiles
Drawstring bag or other opaque drawing container (from now: bag)

Per player:
	5 Houses in the player colour
	5 Churches in the player colour
	5 Popularity tokens (no colour required)
	4 discs with distinguishable sides
	1 player board

## Setup

* Give each player a player board and setup the player pieces on the player board as indicated.
* Put all player discs into the opaque drawing container.
* Shuffle all Landscape Tiles and put them in a 3x3 grid. Put the left over Landscape Tile back in the box.
* Put remaining popularity tokens and all resource tokens within reach.
* Randomly determine a player to begin as the 'drawer'

When placing landscape tiles, place them one at a time.
When placing a landscape tile into the grid, align the star quadrant on the newly placed tile with a matching quadrant from the surrounding quadrants.
If there are multiple surrounding matching quadrants, align with the one which would create the largest contiguous area of that type.

## How to play

Xarkant is played over a number of rounds during which the players take turns performing actions.
Each round consists of multiple action phases and a single cleanup phase.
At the beginning of each action phase the current 'drawer' player will draw an amount of discs from the bag equal to the amount of players.
If there are not enough discs left to draw, simply draw the remaining discs.

Any player with a disc amongst the drawn discs get to take one action for each of their discs, starting with the player sitting to the left of the 'drawer'.

Each disc has two faces; Claim and Work. And the end of a round, if the game is not over, return all discs with the Work side up to the bag, and begin another round.

## Action

If a player has one or more action discs he can perform the following actions.

* Collect Resources
* Claim Land
* Place Workshop
* Place Church
* Place Village
* Trade
* Pass

A player may take any of these actions and in any order.
Most actions require either discs or resources to perform.
Once a player chooses the pass action it is the next players turn.

#### Definitions

* An area is a group of quadrants sharing a type.
* Villages do not have a type and can break up areas.
* An occupied area is an area that has a player disc in it, no matter the side showing.
* An empty space is a space without Workshops, Churches, or Player Discs.

### Collect Resources

A player may place one of their discs, work side up, on an empty quadrant in an unoccupied area.
Then the player collect one resource for each quadrant in the area.
The resources collected must match the area in question.

If the area contains any Workshops, the active player collects 1 additional resource of the same kind for each workshop.
If a workshop belongs to another player than the active player, the owner of the Workshop also collects one resource of that same kind.

When collecting resources a player may pay 1/3/5 Popularity in order to collect an addition 1/2/3 resources of the same kind.

A player must have enough room on his player board to store the collected resources.
If a player does not have enough room on his player board, that player must return any excess resources to the supply.
If a player returns resources due to not having enough room, that player must also return 1 popularity to the supply.

### Claim Land

A player may place one of their discs, claim side up, on an empty quadrant in an unoccupied area.
A claim disc is never returned to the bag and stay on the board for the rest of the game.

### Place Workshop

A player may put a Workshop from his player board into play by paying the cost shown on the player board.
When putting a Workshop into play, the player has 2 choices; Unto the Landscape Tiles or unto the State Board.

A Workshop may be placed into any empty quadrant in an area containing one of the active player's discs showing the work side.
Placing a Workshop unto the Landscape Tiles has no immediate effect but will affect further Collect Resources actions.

A Workshop may also be placed on the state board by paying the additional cost shown there.
Placing a Workshop on the State Board immediately provides the player with 2 Popularity from the supply.

### Place Church

A player may put a Church from his player board into play by paying the cost shown on the player board.
When putting a Church into play, the player has 2 choices; Unto the Landscape Tiles or unto the Church Board.

A Chuch may be placed into any empty quadrant in an area containing one of the active player's discs showing the work side.
A Church may also be placed unto any empty village adjacent to any quadrant of an area containing one of the active player's discs showing the work side.
Placing a Church unto the Landscape Tiles has no immediate effect but will affect end game scoring.
If a Church is placed on a Village, that Village counts as a Town for end game scoring.

A Church may also be placed on the Church Board.
Placing a Church unto the Church Board has no immediate effect but will affect end game scoring.

### Place Village

The amount of available Villages is limited in the game and this action cannot be taken if no Villages are left on the state board.
